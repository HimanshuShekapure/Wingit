Project Title:
 Wingit (Microblogging Platforms)


Microblogging Platform Using MERN Stack - Project Documentation


1. Introduction

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a fully functional microblogging web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project aims to provide users with a seamless platform to share posts, interact with others, and build communities, offering a practical experience in full-stack development.

 Background:
Microblogging platforms like Twitter enable users to express their thoughts concisely. This project will focus on implementing similar features, such as user authentication, post creation, comments, likes, and profile management, while utilizing modern web technologies.

Scope:
- Development of a scalable backend using Node.js and Express.js.
- Responsive and dynamic frontend built with React.js.
- Integration with MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Implementation of features like user authentication, posts, likes, comments, and notifications.
- Deployment of the application to a cloud platform for accessibility.




2. Problem Statement

 Problem:
The lack of simple and intuitive platforms for microblogging that focus on performance, scalability, and a modern user experience.

 Importance:
This project highlights the integration of advanced technologies to create an engaging and scalable solution, providing insights into practical development and deployment processes.

3. Objectives
1. Develop a secure and interactive web application using the MERN stack.
2. Provide features such as post creation, comments, likes, and user profiles.
3. Implement secure user authentication and authorization.
4. Enable real-time notifications and updates.
5. Deploy the application to a cloud platform for public access.

4. Methodology

1. Data Collection:
- Analyze features of popular microblogging platforms.
- Identify user needs and expectations.

2. Tools/Technologies:
•	MongoDB: Database for storing user and post data.
•	Express.js: Backend framework for routing and API creation.
•	React.js: Frontend framework for dynamic user interface.
•	Node.js: Runtime environment for server-side scripting.
•	Tools: JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password encryption, and AWS/GCP for deployment.

 3. Implementation Process:
1. Set up the development environment.
2. Design database schemas for users, posts, and comments.
3. Build RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
4. Develop a responsive frontend using React.js.
5. Integrate frontend and backend.
6. Test the application for functionality, security, and performance.
7. Deploy the final version to a cloud platform.
